### Title 
 What Drives the Selection of Political Information in Google? Tension Between Ideal Democracy and the Influence of Ranking
 
### Abstract
The emergence of the Internet has altered how individuals obtain information – this also applies to political information. Search engines have taken over the role of political information gatekeepers becoming thus key players in a democracy. Through an online survey experiment, which mimicked a Google web interface, this article examines how citizens select political information in a political campaign from a Google search result page. The results suggest that mostly ranking, but also textual cues from snippets drive an individual’s selection of political information in Google. We discuss these findings from a democratic theory perspective.
